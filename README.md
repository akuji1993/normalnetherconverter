# Normal / Nether converter
This is just a little hack I wrote in AngularJS to help a friend with converting Normal world and Nether world coordinates in Minecraft. Just a small tool, not much logic behind it. You can use it by rehosting it on a website of your choice. Free for use. You can also extend it as needed :)
